##TODO

make the static method macro to be just for a fuction with 1 parameter, and to work with any function

sorting the test order (by file, by test suite, or both, ASC/DESC...)

a message macro

case insensitivity (OPTIONAL!!!):
    http://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/63091-strcmp-without-case-sensitivity.html

when comparing filenames use forward slashes

play with boost test and cpp check




finish reading boost doc
    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html

notes:
    expressions passed to CHECK_EQ should evaluate only once

THINK OF IN THE LONG TERM
    make C compatible? HELL NO! namespaces, fixtures, std::map goodness, exception catching
    keep the 2 headers (main and implementation)?
    remove dependency on most stuff like std::map (meaning implementing my own)?
    documentation
        document how to use spaces for filters in the comma separated list (using "")
        tests are ran serially
        document when the library may crash (div by zero, bad ptr deref, etc)
