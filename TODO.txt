##TODO

test suites

switch to using wildcards instead of substrings for filters

filters for file and test suite

exclusion filters - example:
    a.exe
    -doctest_name=asd,*ad*
    -doctest_name_exclude=*adf*
    -doctest_file=*.cpp
    -doctest_file_exclude=*test.cpp
    -doctest_suite=*
    -doctest_suite_exclude=*crap*

make the static method macro to be just for a fuction with 1 parameter, and to work with any function

sorting the test order (by file, by test suite, or both, ASC/DESC...)

a message macro

case insensitivity (OPTIONAL!!!):
    http://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/63091-strcmp-without-case-sensitivity.html

when comparing filenames use forward slashes

add a try catch section

play with boost test and cpp check




finish reading boost doc
    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html

CI
    travis
        compile all examples
        valgrind
            https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy/blob/master/.travis.yml
        clang static analysis
        
        coverage

    msvc
        just compile all the examples

notes:
    expressions passed to CHECK_EQ should evaluate only once

THINK OF IN THE LONG TERM
    make C compatible?
    keep the 2 headers (main and implementation)?
    remove dependency on most stuff like std::map (meaning implementing my own)?
    documentation
        document how to use spaces for filters in the comma separated list (using "")
        tests are ran serially
        document when the library may crash (div by zero, bad ptr deref, etc)
