**doctest** is a new C++ testing framework but is by far the fastest both in compile times (by [**orders of magnitude**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md)) and runtime compared to other feature-rich alternatives. It brings the ability of compiled languages such as [**D**](https://dlang.org/spec/unittest.html) / [**Rust**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/testing.html) / [**Nim**](https://nim-lang.org/docs/unittest.html) to have tests written directly in the production code by providing a fast, transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface.

The framework is and will stay free but needs your support to sustain its development. There are lots of <a href="doc/markdown/roadmap.md"><b>new features</b></a> and maintenance to do. If you work for a company using **doctest** or have the means to do so, please consider financial support. Monthly donations via Patreon and one-offs via PayPal.

A complete example with a self-registering test that compiles to an executable looks like this:

![cover-example](scripts/data/using_doctest_888px_wide.gif)

There are many C++ testing frameworks - [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), [Boost.Test](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html), [UnitTest++](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp), [cpputest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest), [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and many [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C.2B.2B).

The **key** differences between it and other testing frameworks are that it is light and unintrusive:
- Ultra light on compile times both in terms of [**including the header**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md#cost-of-including-the-header) and writing [**thousands of asserts**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md#cost-of-an-assertion-macro)
- Doesn't produce any warnings even on the [**most aggressive**](scripts/cmake/common.cmake#L84) warning levels for **MSVC**/**GCC**/**Clang**
- Offers a way to remove **everything** testing-related from the binary with the [**```DOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE```**](doc/markdown/configuration.md#doctest_config_disable) identifier
- Doesn't pollute the global namespace (everything is in namespace ```doctest```) and doesn't drag **any** headers with it
- Very [**portable**](doc/markdown/features.md#extremely-portable) C++98 - per commit tested on CI with over 330 different builds (static analysis, sanitizers...)

![cost-of-including-the-framework-header](scripts/data/benchmarks/header.png)

This allows the framework to be used in more ways than any other - tests can be written directly in the production code!

Mantra: *Tests can be considered a form of documentation and should be able to reside near the production code which they test.*

- This makes the barrier for writing tests **much lower** - you don't have to: **1)** make a separate source file **2)** include a bunch of stuff in it **3)** add it to the build system and **4)** add it to source control - You can just write the tests for a class or a piece of functionality at the bottom of its source file - or even header file!
- Tests in the production code can be thought of as documentation or up-to-date comments - showing how an API is used
- Testing internals that are not exposed through the public API and headers is no longer a mind-bending exercise
- [**Test-driven development**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in C++ has never been easier!

The framework can be used like any other if you don't want/need to mix production code and tests - check out the [**features**](doc/markdown/features.md).

**doctest** is modeled after [**Catch**](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) and some parts of the code have been taken directly - check out [**the differences**](doc/markdown/faq.md#how-is-doctest-different-from-catch).

[This table](https://github.com/martinmoene/catch-lest-other-comparison) compares **doctest** / [**Catch**](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) / [**lest**](https://github.com/martinmoene/lest) which are all very similar.

Support the development of the project with donations! There is a list of planned features which are all important and big - see the [**roadmap**](doc/markdown/roadmap.md). I took a break from working in the industry to make open source software so every cent is a big deal.
