The lightest feature rich C++ single header testing framework
-------

There are many C++ testing frameworks - [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch), [Boost.Test](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html), [UnitTest++](https://github.com/unittest-cpp/unittest-cpp), [lest](https://github.com/martinmoene/lest), [bandit](http://banditcpp.org/), [igloo](http://igloo-testing.org/), [xUnit++](https://bitbucket.org/moswald/xunit/wiki/Home), [CppTest](http://cpptest.sourceforge.net/), [CppUnit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/), [CxxTest](https://github.com/CxxTest/cxxtest), [cpputest](https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest), [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest), [cute](https://github.com/Kosta-Github/cute) and many [other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unit_testing_frameworks#C.2B.2B).

What makes **doctest** different is that it is ultra light on compile times (by [**orders of magnitude**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md)) and is unintrusive.

A complete example with a self-registering test that compiles to an executable looks like this:

```c++
#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN
#include "doctest.h"

int factorial(int number) { return number <= 1 ? number : factorial(number - 1) * number; }

TEST_CASE("testing the factorial function") {
    CHECK(factorial(1) == 1);
    CHECK(factorial(2) == 2);
    CHECK(factorial(10) == 3628800);
}
```

**doctest** is inspired by the [**```unittest {}```**](https://wiki.dlang.org/Unittest) functionality of the **D** programming language and **Python**'s [**docstrings**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring).

It is modeled after [**Catch**](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) which is currently the most popular and easy to use alternative for testing in C++

The **key** differences between it and other testing libraries are:
- Ultra light - [**below 10ms**](doc/markdown/benchmarks.md) of compile time overhead for including the header in a source file
- Offers a way to remove **everything** testing-related from the binary with the [**```DOCTEST_CONFIG_DISABLE```**](doc/markdown/configuration.md) identifier
- Doesn't pollute the global namespace (everything is in the ```doctest``` namespace) and doesn't drag **any** headers with it
- Doesn't produce any warnings even on the [**most aggressive**](scripts/common.cmake#L59) warning levels for **MSVC**/**GCC**/**Clang**
- Very [**portable and well tested**](doc/markdown/features.md#extremely-portable) C++98 - per commit tested on CI with over 200 different builds (valgrind, sanitizers...)

This allows the library to be used in more ways than any other - tests can be written directly in the production code!

- This makes the barrier for writing tests **much lower** - you don't have to: **1.** make a separate source file **2.** include a bunch of stuff in it **3.** add it to the build system and **4.** add it to source control - You can just write the tests for a class or a piece of functionality at the bottom of it's source file - or even header file!
- Tests in the production code can be thought of as documentation or up to date comments - showing how an API is used
- Tests can be shipped to the customer with the software to diagnose a bug faster
- [**TDD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in C++ has never been easier!

The library can be used like any other if you don't like the idea of mixing production code and tests - check out the [**features**](doc/markdown/features.md)

Contributing
------------

Support the development of the project with donations! There is a list of planned features which are all important and big - see the [**roadmap**](features.md). I work on this project in my spare time and every cent is a big deal. I took a break from working in the industry to make open source software.

Contributions in the form of issues and pull requests are welcome as well.

Open an issue for a discussion before making a pull request to make sure the contribution goes smoothly. 

This framework has some design goals which must be kept. Make sure you have read the [**features and design goals**](doc/markdown/features.md) page.

The ```master``` branch is the stable one with the latest release and the ```dev``` branch is on the bleeding edge.

All the framework tests (using ctest) have their output collected when the CMake ```TEST_MODE``` variable is set to ```COLLECT``` (making the new reference output) and later the tests are ran on the CI services (```travis``` and ```appveyor```) - their output is compared with the current reference output in the repository with the ```COMPARE``` mode (default mode is ```COMPARE```).

Code should be formatted with a recent-enough ```clang-format``` using the config file in the root of the repo (or I will do it...)

Testing with compilers different from GCC/Clang/MSVC (and more platforms) is something the project would benefit from.
