## Description
<!--
Describe the what and the why of your pull request. Remember that these two
are usually a bit different. As an example, if you have made various changes
to decrease the number of new strings allocated, that's what. The why probably
was that you have a large set of tests and found that this speeds them up.

## GitHub Issues
<!-- 
If this PR was motivated by some existing issues, reference them here.

If it is a simple bug-fix, please also add a line like 'Closes #123'
to your commit message, so that it is automatically closed.
If it is not, don't, as it might take several iterations for a feature
to be done properly. If in doubt, leave it open and reference it in the
PR itself, so that maintainers can decide.
