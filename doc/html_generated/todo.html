## TODO FOR FIRST RELEASE

- make a string class
- rewrite stuff so that there are no getter functions of statics (and less pointers please!)
- ability to not run tests at all
- move to RAII instead of atexit() bullshit (and maybe stop this void* BS)
- the CHECK() macro - OPTIONAL!!! break on failed CHECK() macros in doctest
- sections! (and maybe remove fixtures and make sections/tests with only 1 macro)
- a message macro
- error checking of parameters (if the range is valid (first <= last), etc)
- trim "\"" from test/fixture/testsuite names? will require allocations...
- sorting the test order (by file, by test suite, or both, ASC/DESC...)
- timing reports of tests, duration restrictions, kill of longer than, etc...
- look at catch command line options
- __attribute((unused))__ for tests when disabled globally (or made as templates that never get instantiated)
- error reporting
- MSVC/IDE integration
- make a compact reporter (for within ide-s - just the file and line number)
- streaming reporters???
- signal handling for unix: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/csignal/signal/
- fixing warnings gcc/clang/msvc (and add more stuff in the disabled example)
- more aggressive gcc/clang warnings! http://meetingcpp.com/tl_files/2014/talks/robust_code.pdf
- test coverage
- documentation

## FUTURE
- integrate sanitizers into CI builds
- xml reporter (jUnit compatible, etc.)
- test execution in separate processes - UNIX only with fork()
- ability to transfer/copy registered functions from one dll to another so they are put in one set and duplicates are filtered
- hierarchical test suites? using a stack for the pushed states
- use a pool for the allocations because 1k+ allocs before entering main() can be heavy

## DOCUMENTATION
- profile doctest vs Catch (compile/startup)
- defense of macros in testing frameworks: http://accu.org/var/uploads/journals/Overload125.pdf
- whats the library's main purpose
- warning free even with the most aggressive options for all 3 major compilers
- mocking is not included because it is orthogonal to testing and a different third party library may be used for that (google mock)
- document how to use spaces for filters in the comma separated list (using "")
- tests are ran serially
- document all the options
- initially was planning on a C version of the library but figured that there is no reason to choose C over C++ anywhere
