## Roadmap

Support the development of the project with donations! I work on this project in my spare time and every cent is a big deal.

[![Donate to support](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/31280.png)](https://pledgie.com/campaigns/31280)

This is a list of planned features for future releases (maybe in the given order).

- fix the test coverage reports - currently each example replaces the coverage from the last example
- test with gcc 6 and use it in the CI builds
- support for ```std::exception``` and derivatives (mainly for calling the ```.what()``` method when caught unexpectedly)
- test with missed warning flags for GCC - look into https://github.com/Barro/compiler-warnings
- crash handling: signals on UNIX platforms or structured exceptions on Windows
- support for tags
    - may fail tag
    - invisible tag
    - look at Catch - https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/test-cases-and-sections.html#special-tags
- output to file
- reporters
    - a system for writing custom reporters
    - ability to use multiple reporters at once (but only 1 to stdout)
    - a compact reporter
    - an xml reporter
    - jUnit/xUnit reporters
- add the ability to query if code is currently being ran in a test -  ```doctest::isRunningInTest()```
- convolution support for the assertion macros (with a predicate)
- time stuff
    - reporting running time of tests
    - restricting duration of test cases
    - killing a test that exceeds a time limit (will perhaps require threading or processes)
- adding contextual info to asserts (logging) - with an ```INFO```/```CONTEXT``` /```TRACEPOINT``` macro
- add ```ERROR```/```FAIL``` macros
- running tests a few times
- marking a test to run X times (should also multiply with the global test run times)
- test execution in separate processes - ```fork()``` for UNIX and [this](https://github.com/nemequ/munit/issues/2) for Windows
- ability to provide a temp folder that is cleared between each test case
- detect floating point exceptions
- ```Bitwise()``` class that has overloaded operators for comparison - to be used to check objects bitwise against each other
- integrate static analysis on the CI: **msvc**, **clang**, **cppcheck**
- get a build with **MinGW-w64** running on **appveyor**

And here is a list of things that are being considered but not part of the roadmap yet:

- matchers - should investigate what they are :D
- option to list files in which  there are test cases who match the current filters
- handle ```wchar``` strings
- refactor the assertion macros - make proxy functions that do most of the things to minimize code bloat
- pool allocator for the ```String``` class - currently very unoptimized
- ability to specify ASC/DESC for the order option
- command line error handling/reporting
- utf8? not sure if this should be here
- print a warning when no assertion is encountered in a test case
- hierarchical test suites - using a stack for the pushed ones - should be easy
- put everything from the ```detail``` namespace also in a nested anonymous namespace to make them with internal linkage
- ability to re-run only newly compiled tests based on time stamps using ```__DATE__``` and ```__TIME__``` - stored in some file
