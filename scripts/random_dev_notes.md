addFailedAssert should be called when an assert crashes



decorators
    timeouts
    expectedFailures?
    maybes? shoulds?

log the "randomness" for example in the xml output
    also filters and options!
    also in the console reporter!

flip the xml output switch & commit the sources
check coverage

get rid of DOCTEST_DECLARE_DEFAULTS & friends...
    AND get rid of DOCTEST_INTERFACE for simple structs!

merge this
    https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/pull/197
    redo benchmarks (and add a <string> include along with the framework haeder :D)
    fix docs

On release - mention these:
    - can be used for listening for events
    - multiple reporters/listeners can be used at the same time
    - custom reporters can be written
    - register and choose reporters
    - list all reporters
    - output to file (or just not stdout)
    - xml output

rope-ish startup of doctest - and filter duplicates on run()

https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-10-11-windows-early-release

add in the faq about the compile errors with stream<<"array" - nikola goranov, also moving to catch undef/define stuffs - use vararg macro, also make the "moving from catch to doctest" easier to find, also this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35530850/how-to-require-a-semicolon-after-a-macro/52122660#52122660



fix discoverability of subcases
    look at the subcase filtering and the filter_3 example - the test case is re-entered when in fact it shouldn't have
        convoluted to solve - not really important

try to forward declare std::string and specialize the string maker for it or something like that

== how to deal with pull requests for the main branch instead of the dev branch
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9135913/merge-pull-request-to-a-different-branch-than-default-in-github
- git fetch origin pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME         << BRANCHNAME should be a new local branch! and then rebase it

  check_eq(numDigits(0), 1);     numDigits returns uint32
